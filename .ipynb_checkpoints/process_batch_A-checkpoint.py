"""
Batch Process A - First Transformation

Read from a file, transform, and write to a new file.
In this case, convert degrees F to degrees C.

Note: 
This is a batch process, but the file objects we use are 
often called 'file-like objects' or 'streams'.
Streaming differs in that the input data is unbounded.

Use logging, very helpful when working with batch and streaming processes.
